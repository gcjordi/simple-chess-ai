# AI Chess on AWS Amplify for Education and Healthcare 

## A simple chess algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and board evaluation with piece-square tables.

The game of chess has been an excellent ally of artificial intelligence for many years and it has been a long time since it beat a human for the first time (https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en /icons/deepblue/). 

Creating a system, algorithm or application (which in this case is based on https://github.com/lhartikk/simple-chess-ai) should not be anything new, but the approach proposed here seeks to demonstrate the next: 

How an intelligent chess game system can be implemented in a few minutes thanks to Amplify, easily available from any device, anytime, anywhere. 

How the implementation of this application can help develop algorithmic improvements, but also how it can be applied in areas such as education or health, among others, by easily making available to schools and training centers, for example, a sample system of how intelligence works artificial intelligence, machine learning, decision trees, etc. And also making neurological, cognitive, etc. rehabilitation therapy available to patients. 

This demo example:

(Made for example purposes only for the Hackathon) 

It is presented in the following Hackathon:

(IF THE ORGANIZERS OF THE HACKATHON WISH TO TEST IT, THEY CAN ASK ME FOR THE ACCESS CREDENTIALS) 

In relation to the deployment carried out, note the following essential points: 

Added code monitoring in the master branch of the repository. 

Username and password have been added for the use of the application for a more robust security and to avoid improper use. 

Added enable request previews in the deployment branch in AWS Amplify. 

Added a canary for heartbeat monitoring in AWS CloudWatch to the AWS Amplify deployment and enabled AWS X-Ray active tracing.
